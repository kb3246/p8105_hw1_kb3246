# Problem 1

```{r }
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This is the Penguins data set: 

`r skim(penguins)`

- It has three factor variables, species, island and sex, and five numeric variables, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and year. 

- Three species of penguins were studied in this dataset, Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap, across three     islands, Torgersen, Dream and Biscoe.

- Data was collected across the years 2007-2009.

- It has `r nrow(penguins)` observations and `r ncol(penguins)` variables, i.e., a total of 344 penguins were studied and data across 8 different aspects were collected for each penguin.

- The mean flipper length is `r round(mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE),2)`mm.
